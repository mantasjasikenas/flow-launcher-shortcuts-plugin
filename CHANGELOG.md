# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

- Editor app

## [1.2.3] - 2025-xx-xx

- Removed default title autocompletion for commands. Invoking autocompletion will replace the query with the same query
  text.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-01-22

- Support for shell type `Pwsh`.
- If action is not specified for query result, pressing `Enter` will not close the launcher.
- Snippet shortcut type. Executing a snippet shortcut will copy the snippet value to the clipboard. Better would be if
  executing a snippet shortcut will paste the snippet value to the active window but didn't find a way to do that so
  far. Example:

  ```json
  {
    "Type": "Snippet",
    "Value": "Hello\rworld",
    "Key": "hi"
  }
  ```
- Autocompleting on Shell shortcut type changes the query to shell plugin keyword followed by the shell shortcut
  arguments.
- Changed the default behavior of list commands (`q list`, `q snippets`, `q group list`). Now invoking item from the
  list will replace the query with the selected item.
- Removed default argument assignment when shortcut had only one argument. Now the user has to provide the argument name
  when invoking the shortcut. This change was made due conflicts with other functionality.
- Added positional arguments support. For example, you have URL shortcut with the following arguments:

  ```json
  {
    "Type": "Url",
    "Url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=${value}&list=${list}",
    "Key": "yt"
  }
  ```

  Before, you had to provide the arguments in the following way: `q yt -value watch -list later`. Now you can provide
  the arguments in the following way: `q yt -1 watch -2 later`. The numbers represent the argument position in the
  shortcut. Numbering starts from 1.
- Fixed group shortcuts invocation bug when the group shortcut name contained spaces.

## [1.2.1] - 2024-09-24

- Do not autocomplete the result when Enter is pressed if the argument is not a literal type.
- Added a `LaunchGroup` field to group shortcuts. If set to `true`, you can launch all shortcuts in the group
  simultaneously. Otherwise, you can only launch a single shortcut from the group at a time.
- When the group shortcut name (key) is not fully typed, selecting the group shortcut from the list will replace the
  query with the group shortcut name.
- Icons folder support: If a directory type shortcut with the key `icons` is added, the plugin will search for icons for
  shortcuts based on the shortcut key matching the icon file name. The icon file name should be the same as the
  shortcut. Supported file extensions: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.ico`.

- Alias support for shortcuts. Add `Alias` field in the shortcut JSON file. Provide the alias name. Example:

  ```json
  {
    "Type": "Directory",
    "Path": "C:\\Users\\tutta\\Storage\\Dev",
    "Key": "dev",
    "Alias": ["development", "devs"]
  }
  ```
- Show associated icons for shortcuts in the search results

  Provide the full path to the icon file. Example:

    "Type": "Directory",
    "Path": "C:\\Users\\tutta\\Storage\\Dev",
    "Key": "dev",
    "Icon": "C:\\Users\\tutta\\Storage\\Dev\\Projects\\ShortcutPlugin\\Flow.Launcher.Plugin.ShortcutPlugin\\Images\\discord-mark-white.png"

  ```json
  [{
    "Type": "Url",
    "Url": "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=WL",
    "App": "msedge.exe",
    "Key": "wl2"
